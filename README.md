## Installing

There are two ways of installing this -- manually or with the install script.

When cloning this repository, be sure to also have [git](http://git-scm.com/)
installed. This Mercurial repository uses git submodules to include external
plugins.

### Manually

#### On Windows

	cd %USERPROFILE%
	hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jasonwhite/.vim vimfiles
	mklink /H _vimrc "vimfiles/vimrc"
	mklink /H _gvimrc "vimfiles/gvimrc"

#### On Unix

	hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jasonwhite/.vim ~/.vim
	ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
	ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

### Install Script
Using this method, you can clone this repository to any directory you want. The
install script will take care of copying the files to your home directory and
setting up the `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc` files. Be careful though, the install
script will overwrite any existing files. Be sure to backup any existing Vim
files in your home directory.

I only recommend using this method over the manual method if you wish to keep
the cloned repository "untainted" by files that are automatically generated by
Vim and its plugins.

#### On Windows

	hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jasonwhite/.vim dotvim
	cd dotvim
	install

#### On Unix

	hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jasonwhite/.vim dotvim
	cd dotvim
	./install
